# JK Occupational Therapy
Occupational Therapy helps people to participate in everyday meaningful activities.Occupational Therapists work with people of all ages, helping them to carry out the activities that they need or want to do in order to lead healthy and fulfilling lives.Occupational therapists (OTs) work to break down the barriers which hold
back individuals in carrying out their day to day activities. When the assessment is complete the occupational therapist will work with the patient to identify goals that Occupational Therapy can help to achieve. They will listen to what is important to you and see if they can either, help restore your ability to do your everyday occupations, or find another way of achieving your goal.

I manually tested the functions of navigation menu, header, all the three pages, pictures in the gallery, contact form submission with a response and footer links are working at optimised level.

## Bug fixing

On Gitpod terminal, I couldn’t git commit and push my work. After a few unsuccessful attempts I reached my tutor who kindly helped me to fix conflicts in index.html and style.css by accepting current changes.

On HTML validation I got a prompt that a section is lacking a Heading. I followed the instructions and used h1 elements to fix the issue.
