# JK Occupational Therapy
Occupational Therapy helps people to participate in everyday meaningful activities.Occupational Therapists work with people of all ages, helping them to carry out the activities that they need or want to do in order to lead healthy and fulfilling lives.Occupational therapists (OTs) work to break down the barriers which hold
back individuals in carrying out their day to day activities. When the assessment is complete the occupational therapist will work with the patient to identify goals that Occupational Therapy can help to achieve. They will listen to what is important to you and see if they can either, help restore your ability to do your everyday occupations, or find another way of achieving your goal.

Responsiveness was checked using Google Chrome Dev Tools, desktop, mobile, tablet and laptop for all screen sizes with optimum resolutions.

## Bug fixing

I faced my issues during this project and with help of resourcing the source fron google, tutor support i fixed it. i mentioned few bugs here.
1. I have alot of difficulties to change sqlite to postgres in Heroku. With the help of tutor support i manage to resolve the problem.
2. When i updated the model, the change did not update in the Heroku, With the help of tutor support i manage to resolve the problem by resetting postgres in Heroku.
3. I have difficulties in understanding  how to render the templates. Manage to resolve the problem by reviewing the walkthroughs multiple times.
4. I had two errors in the console Uncaught TypeError: emailjs is undefined and Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined. It is fixed with Tutor Support.<br>

# Deployment
Deployment of this website was done through GitHub pages using the following methods:
Git and GitHub are used for version control. Python is the backend language, and can't be displayed with GitHub alone, To live preview my project, I used Heroku.
 * ### Deployment Steps On Heroku.
    -  In my project i've used Django v3.2, so I used this command `pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn` to install django.
    - So inside the terminal added these libraries:  
        `pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2`,  
        `pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage`
    - Created requirements.txt file where I can save all the libraries i've installed:  
        `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
    - To create my project typed this command:  
        `django-admin startproject dentist`
    - To create my app:  
        `python3 manage.py startapp booking_app`

    - To make this app work, Into the setting.py file inside `INSTALLED_APPS` added `booking_app`
    - To migrate changes typed this command:  
        `python3 manage.py migrate`
    - To run the test if the project is working `python3 manage.py runserver`

    - When deploying for the first time on Heroku, you must first register with Heroku.
    - Create your project name and location.
    - To add Database into the app, Locate in the Resources Tab, Add-ons, search and add 'Heroku Postgres'
    - Copy DATABASE_URL value, by going into the Settings Tab, click reveal Config Vars, Copy Text
    - In your workspace Create new env.py file.
    - Import os library:  
            `import os`
    - Set environment variables:  
            `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Heroku DATABASE_URL"`
    - Add in secret key:  
            `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "mysecretkey"`
    - Add Secret Key to Config Vars in Heroku settings:  
            `SECRET_KEY, "mysecretkey"`

    - Add env.py file to the settings.py file:  
            `import os`  
            `import dj_database_url`

            `if os.path.isfile("env.py"):`  
                `import env`
    - Remove the insecure secret key and replace - links to the SECRET_KEY variable on Heroku:  
            `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`

    - Comment out the old DATABASES variable in setting.py file and add this instead:  
            `DATABASES = { 'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`

    - Save all files and Make Migrations:  
            `python3 manage.py migrate`

    - Make account with Cloudinary To get static and media files.
    - From Cloudinary Dashboard, Copy your `CLOUDINARY_URL`:  
    - Add Cloudinary URL to env.py file:  
            `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://************************"`

    - Add Cloudinary URL to Heroku Config Vars:  
            `"cloudinary://************************"`

    - Temperoily add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC inside the heroku config Vars:  
            `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC, 1`

    - Add Cloudinary Libraries to settings.py installed apps:  
            `INSTALLED_APPS = ['cloudinary_storage', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'cloudinary']`

    - In the settings.py file under the `STATIC_URL = 'static/'` add:  
            `STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'`  
            `STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]`  
            `STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')`  

            `MEDIA_URL = '/media/'`  
            `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'`  

    - Place under the BASE_DIR line in settings.py:  
            `TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')`

    - Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR Place within the TEMPLATES array:  
            `TEMPLATES = [{'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],],},},]`

    - Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS:  
            `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["hash-dental-care.herokuapp.com", "localhost"]`

    - Create 3 new folders on top level directory:  
            media, static, templates

    - Create Procfile on the top level directory and inside the file add this:  
            `web: gunicorn dentist.wsgi`
        
    - before deploying on heroku make sure: 
            `DEBUG = False`
            Remove `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` from the config vars.
