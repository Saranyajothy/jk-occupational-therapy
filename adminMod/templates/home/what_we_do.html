                <p>“Occupational therapy is a client-centred health profession concerned with
                    promoting health and well-being through occupation. The primary goal of
                    occupational therapy is to enable people to participate in activities of everyday
                    life.”  World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT)
                </p> <br>
                <h3 class="border">What to expect when I meet an occupational therapist?</h3>
                <img class="mx-auto d-block"src="{% static 'images/senior.jpg' %}"/> <br>
                <p>On the initial assessment, the occupational therapist will involve with you to know your
                    medical history and will also find out how your illness, injury or disability is affecting you and
                    your occupations - the everyday things we do to take care of ourselves and others; socialise
                    and have fun; and work and contribute to our community/society.
                </p> <br>
                <p><strong>When an occupational therapist assesses you they may do any of the following to help them
                    identify how they can help you:</strong> 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get you to explain what has been happening in your life and the difficulties you are
                        experiencing</li>
                    <li>Involve you in activities that will demonstrate the difficulties you are having doing everyday
                        activities</li>
                    <li>Use formal tests and Occupational Therapy assessment</li>
                    <li>Do a home visit to see how you are managing with your everyday occupations at home</li>
                    <li>Other types of assessment, e.g. seating assessment, cognitive assessment, etc</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>When the assessment is complete the occupational therapist will work with you to identify
                goals that Occupational Therapy can help you achieve. They will listen to what is important
                to you and see if they can either, help restore your ability to do your everyday occupations,
                or find another way of achieving your goal.

                <p><strong>Example of Occupational Therapy with an Adult</strong></p>

                <p>An man who requires his home to be adapted to suit his needs due a
                    physical disability is referred to an Occupational Therapist. The
                    occupational therapist will carry out a home visit to assess what changes
                    are required to enable him to live independently in his own home and be
                    able to engage fully in his daily occupations. The occupational therapist
                    will work with him to make a plan for adapting his home and support him
                    in implementing this plan.

                    Ageing and health changes in our lives may mean we have difficulty in managing daily tasks
                    at home, for example, showering, making meals, entering and leaving our homes. Advice
                    from an occupational therapist regarding home modifications can allow you to gain more
                    control over your daily life, allow you to live at home more safely and comfortably as your
                    needs changes.

                <h4 class="border">Seating:</h4>
                <p>JK OT services have wide experience in providing seating and postural support to clients
                    who require mobility, seating and postural needs. Among the most common solutions we
                    provide include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lightweight wheelchairs for occasional use</li>
                    <li>Manual or electrically-operated chairs to ensure day-to-day independence</li>
                    <li>Positioning aids and cushions to maximise comfort and relieve pressure</li>
                    <li>Supportive, comfortable armchairs suitable for those with orthopedic or other
                        problems</li>
                    <li>Guidance with night-time positioning to aid restful sleep</li>
                    <li>Training and support for staff and carers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The aim of an occupational therapy assessment is to identify your seating needs in light of
                    any health conditions you may have, as well as environmental factors that need to be
                    considered. This allows us make recommendations to reduce them and (if desired) arrange
                    for any recommended changes to be made to restore the maximum degree of
                    independence in the home.
